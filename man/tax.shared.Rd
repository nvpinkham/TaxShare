\usage{
tax.shared(
  otu,
  var,
  group1,
  group2,
  tax.level = tax$family,
  PresAbs = F,
  log = T,
  taxa2include
)
}
\arguments{
\item{otu}{A matrix or data frame of OTU abundances (samples in rows, OTUs in columns).}

\item{var}{A vector indicating group membership for each sample (must match rows of \code{otu}).}

\item{group1}{A value from \code{var} representing the first group.}

\item{group2}{A value from \code{var} representing the second group.}

\item{tax.level}{A vector assigning taxonomic classification (e.g., family) to each OTU column. Default is \code{tax$family}.}

\item{PresAbs}{Logical; if TRUE, convert OTU counts to presence/absence (binary). Default is FALSE.}

\item{log}{Logical; if TRUE, apply log10(x + 1) transformation to the matrix and plot axis. Default is TRUE.}

\item{taxa2include}{Optional vector of taxa names to display in the plot. If supplied, only these taxa will be shown.}
}
\value{
A matrix of taxonomic group medians (possibly log-transformed), invisibly returned. Also generates a barplot for visual inspection.
}
\description{
This function visualizes differences in taxonomic abundance between two groups
by creating a horizontal barplot of shared and unique taxa, based on the results from
\code{tax.shared.table()}. It supports log transformation and subsetting to specific taxa.
}
\details{
This function builds upon \code{tax.shared.table()} to generate a visual summary of taxa shared and unique to two groups. Bar lengths represent median abundance (or presence) for each taxon in the respective group.
